Once you submit a withdrawal request, our finance team processes it within 24-48 hours for e-wallets, 3-5 business days for bank transfers, and up to 7 days for credit card refunds depending on your bank's processing times across Australia.<\/p>\n\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; list-style-position: outside;\">\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\">\n    <strong>Account Verification Requirements:<\/strong> First-time withdrawals require identity verification through government-issued photo ID (Australian driver's license or passport), proof of address dated within 90 days (utility bill or bank statement), and payment method verification (photo of credit card with middle digits masked or e-wallet screenshot). This KYC process complies with anti-money laundering regulations protecting Australian players.\n  <\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\">\n    <strong>Withdrawal Limits & Fees:<\/strong> Standard withdrawal limits range from $20 minimum to $5,000 maximum per transaction, with higher limits available for VIP members reaching $20,000 per week.

After this window, transactions process irreversibly. Successfully verified accounts experience faster processing with reduced pending times for subsequent withdrawals.\n  <\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\">\n    <strong>Cryptocurrency Withdrawals:<\/strong> Bitcoin and altcoin withdrawals process fastest, typically completing within 24 hours once your transaction reaches blockchain confirmation.
